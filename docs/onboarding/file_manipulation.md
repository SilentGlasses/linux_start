    - `nano`: A simple command-line text editor for editing files.
        - Example: `nano filename`
=== "Managing Permissions"
    - `chmod`: Change the permissions of a file or directory.
        - Example: `chmod permissions filename`
    - `chown`: Change the ownership of a file or directory.
        - Example: `chown user:group filename`
=== "Finding Files and renaming"
    - `find`: Search for files and directories based on various criteria.
        - Example: `find /path/to/search -name filename`    
=== "Navigating the File System"
    - `cd`: Change directory. Use this command to navigate between directories.
        - Example: `cd /path/to/directory`
    - `pwd`: Print the current working directory. This command displays the full path of the current directory.
        - Example: `pwd`
    - `ls`: List files and directories in the current directory.
        - Example: `ls`
    - `ls -l`: List files and directories in long format, providing detailed information such as permissions, ownership, size, and modification time.
        - Example: `ls -l`
    - `ls -a`: List all files and directories, including hidden files that start with a dot (.)
        - Example: `ls -a`

## File Compression and Archiving:

- `tar`: Create or extract tar archives.
    - Example: `tar -cvf archive.tar files` (create)
        - Example: `tar -xvf archive.tar` (extract)
- `gzip`: Compress files using the gzip algorithm.
    - Example: `gzip filename` (compress)
    - Example: `gzip -d filename.gz` (decompress)

## Managing Symbolic Links:

- `ln`: Create symbolic links to files or directories.
    - Example: `ln -s source_file link_name`
- `readlink`: Display the target of a symbolic link.
    - Example: `readlink link_name`

## File Permissions and Attributes:

- `stat`: Display detailed information about a file or directory, including permissions, ownership, size, and timestamps.
    - Example: `stat filename`
- `chattr`: Change file attributes such as immutability or append-only.
    - Example: `chattr +i filename` (set immutable)
