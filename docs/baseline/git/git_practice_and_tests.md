# Git and GitHub Practice: Self-Test and Exercises

Practice is the best way to learn Git and GitHub. Use these exercises to test your skills and reinforce what youâ€™ve learned.

## Basic Git Tasks

- **Create a New Repository**
  - Initialize a new Git repository and make your first commit.
- **Stage and Commit Changes**

  - Amend your last commit (`git commit --amend`)
  - Revert a commit (`git revert <commit-hash>`)

## Branching and Merging

- **Create and Switch Branches**
  - `git checkout -b feature-branch`
- **Merge Branches**
  - Merge your feature branch into `main` and resolve any conflicts.
- **Delete Branches**
  - `git branch -d feature-branch`

## Working with Remotes

- **Add a Remote and Push**
  - `git remote add origin <url>`
  - `git push -u origin main`
- **Pull Changes**
  - `git pull origin main`
- **Handle Merge Conflicts**
  - Practice resolving a conflict after pulling remote changes.

## GitHub Practice

- **Fork a Repository**
  - Fork a public repo and clone it locally.
- **Submit a Pull Request**
  - Make a change and open a pull request to the original repo.
- **Open and Close Issues**
  - Create an issue and close it after resolving.
- **Assign Reviewers and Labels**
