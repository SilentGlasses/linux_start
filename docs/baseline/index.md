I use Pop!_OS which is based off Ubuntu so this section will be mostly around this distro. You should be able to follow this on most any distro with minor tweaking.

The Baseline section will allow you to et started with Linux including things like setting up your SSH keys, getting brew installed, installing Ruby and some other tidbits.
