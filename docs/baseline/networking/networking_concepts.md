# Networking Concepts

Before diving into networking commands and tools, it's essential to understand the fundamental concepts that underpin all networking. These concepts provide the context for using tools effectively.

## IP Addresses

- **IPv4**: A 32-bit address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) used to identify devices on a network.
- **IPv6**: A 128-bit address designed to replace IPv4, offering more unique addresses and better security.

### Why It Matters

IP addresses are like the "home addresses" of devices on a network. They allow devices to find and communicate with each other.

## Subnets

- Subnets divide a network into smaller segments to improve performance and security.
- **Subnet Mask**: Indicates which part of an IP address identifies the network vs. the host.

### Why It Matters

Subnets optimize network traffic and enhance security by isolating sections of a network.

## DNS (Domain Name System)

- Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `google.com`) into IP addresses.

### Why It Matters

Without DNS, you'd need to remember IP addresses for every website or service you want to access.

## Ports

- Ports are unique endpoints for specific types of network communication.
  - **HTTP**: Port 80
  - **HTTPS**: Port 443
  - **SSH**: Port 22

### Why It Matters

Understanding ports helps you identify and troubleshoot issues related to specific services.

## Protocols
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Reliable, connection-based communication.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Faster, connectionless communication.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Protocols for web traffic.

### Why It Matters

Protocols define how data is transmitted and received, making them critical for troubleshooting communication issues.
